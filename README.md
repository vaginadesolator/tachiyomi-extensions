This repository contains the available extension catalogues for the [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) app.


# Usage

Extension sources can be downloaded, installed, and uninstalled via the main Tachiyomi app. They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.

## Downloads

If you prefer to directly download the APK files, they are available via https://tachiyomi.org/extensions/ or directly in this GitHub repository in the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/tree/repo/apk).


# Requests

Source requests here are meant as up-for-grabs for any developer, thus it's impossible to provide a time estimation for any of them. Furthermore, some sites are impossible to do, usually because of various technical reasons.
